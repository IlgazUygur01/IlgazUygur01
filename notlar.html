                <h3>Topic 1.1: Collaboration</h3>
                <p>Working together helps bring in different ideas and reduces mistakes. It's important to find good ways to work with others in coding so that you can solve problems better.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="note">
                <h3>Topic 1.2: Computer Innovations</h3>
                <p>New inventions in computers can be both digital (software) or physical (hardware). We use many of them every day. To understand them, we should ask: Why were they made? What problems do they solve? What new things can they do?</p>
                <p>Programs take input in many ways: touch, sound, visuals, or text (including numbers). They respond to these inputs with a series of steps. Code segments are small pieces of these programs that follow specific rules.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <h3>Topic 1.3: Program Development</h3>
                <p>When creating programs, developers first think about what limits there are, what users need, and the goals. They plan and then build the program. Because teams often build programs together, it's important to give credit to everyone who helped.</p>
                <p>Good documentation (notes about the code) is important. It helps track the work and shows who did what. Most programming languages allow you to leave comments in the code, which makes documentation easier.</p>

                <h3>Topic 1.4: Errors in Programming</h3>
                <p>Errors (mistakes) in coding are common and come in different types: logic errors, syntax errors, runtime errors, and overflow errors.</p>
                <p>Logic errors happen when the plan to solve a problem is wrong. Syntax errors are mistakes in how the code is written, like spelling mistakes. Runtime errors, or bugs, happen when the program runs. Overflow errors happen when the program tries to handle numbers that are too big.</p>
                <p>There are ways to fix errors, like using test cases, tracing the program step by step, debugging tools, and visualizing the process. Syntax errors are usually easy to spot, but logic errors can take more time. Testing is part of the coding process to make sure the program works correctly for all inputs.</p>
