        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Nadin, and I'm a senior at Stanford University studying Computer Science (focusing on Human-Computer Interaction) &amp; Education. After graduation, I'll be joining Figma as a Software Engineer!</p>
        <p>Writing code empowers me to make a positive impact on the worldâ€”I believe strongly in applying technology to social good, and I'm especially interested in educational technology. Within computer science, I'm interested in human-computer interaction and mobile development. My educational interests lie within language learning and early childhood education.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing games on my Nintendo Switch, reading detective novels, and crocheting stuffed animals.</p>
